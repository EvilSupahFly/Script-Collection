## Script to automate converting MP4 and M4A files to MP3 format.

To use this script:
  * download mp4-to-mp3.sh from here
  * make the script executable
  * open a terminal in a folder with MP4 or M4A files and type:
    - `./mp4-to-mp3.sh ./`

If errors are encountered, it will leave a message about the problem file and move on to the next (if available).

Currently, this only runs on APT based distros.
