### The Motherlode
There are two files here:
   1. `bash.bashrc` - taken from my my daily driver, this lives in `/etc/bash.bashrc` and is avaiable system wide to all terminal users.
   2. `user.bashrc` - also taken from my daily driver, this is my `~/.bashrc` and is only impacts my terminal sessions.

I called it `The Motherlode` because these two files contain every single function (plus a few extras) described in this project.

For those who are new to Linux, this is a live demo to show you how to integrate these functions into your own system.

Apologies if the colour code explanation table in `user.bashrc` is a bit repetitious - I had originally copied several tables directly into `~/.bashrc` to reference when editing.
